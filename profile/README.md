Welcome to the Heliophysics Environmental and Radiation Measurement Experiment Suite (HERMES) Science Operations Center (SOC) codebase.
This project is part of the Space Weather Science Operations Center (SWSOC).
This set of repositories is responsive to the new [NASA SMD Heliophysics (HPD) Data Policy](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/HPD_Data_Policy_Final_20220209_TAGGED.pdf) requirement that 
  * HPD-funded software shall be released under a permissive license that has
broad acceptance in the community and shall be made available in a publicly
accessible repository that is widely recognized by the community. If
commercial software is used, then the HPD-funded executable code shall be
released and made available.

## Code of Conduct

Interactions in this community are governed by
